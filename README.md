# Fun with Collatz
Having fun with the Collatz Conjecture. Math, am I right?

The Collataz Conjecture is a mathematical proposition that follows these rules:

- Start with a positive integer (n)
- If the term is even, divide by 2 to get the next term (i.e. n/2)
- If the term is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 (i.e. 3n + 1)

Each sequence may vary widely but will always end in an infinite loop of the numbers 4, 2, 1

This becomes and infinite loop as 4 / 2 = 2 then 2 / 2 = 1 then 1 * 3 + 1 = 4 then 4 / 2 = 2 and so on and so on....
